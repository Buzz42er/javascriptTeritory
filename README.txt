All that I'm trying to do here is to have all of the js statements
the code itself will probably not work and i don't need it to, all i need is to have them cronologicly arranged
and that's what I am doing
hope you don't get heart attack when you see it haha :)
there is probably a lot of typos so sorry in advance, I'll try to minimize them
